# Project Overview

PiNode-DOGE is a completely free and open source suite of tools to help a user run their own Dogecoin node with ease. PiNode-DOGE is designed for use with single board computers (SBC) such as the Raspberry Pi, Pine64 or Odroid hardware to allow for very cheap node setup and minimal 24/7 running costs due to low power usage.

After setup, normal interaction is available through a built in web interface accessible from any device on your local network.
